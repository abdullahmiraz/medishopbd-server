1. if the user selected a medicine that requires presecriptions, you have to upload a presecription image immediately, or else you cannot proceed to the '/checkout' page


 4. generate sales/orders report based on the dates/products sale etc
5.******  user will be able to see their order history (save to 'orders' using mongoose)
            #And from there, user will be able to generate the prescription again, those text which will be saved to generate the PDF



remove orders from the User.js Schema, as its not needed, cause if i save the order details and already there is userId saved, then we dont need any, Note: dont check buyer using their id, using their email or phone number track their order history, date etc

* assign users to their roles and what they will be able to see


add customer photo update for the presecription and setup their image link with imgbb

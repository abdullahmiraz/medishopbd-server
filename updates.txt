1. if the user selected a medicine that requires presecriptions, you have to upload a presecription image immediately, or else you cannot proceed to the '/checkout' page
2. in the products list (in dashboard/productlist) :
        add another button that will take to a page , detailed about the product (tip: just copy the editproduct component system, instead of the input just use <p> tag</p> and show their value, that you've passed from)

3. add login system for the user
4. generate sales/orders report based on the dates/products sale etc
5. user will be able to see their order history (save to 'orders' using mongoose)
            #And from there, user will be able to generate the prescription again, those text which will be saved to generate the PDF

1. if the user selected a medicine that requires presecriptions, you have to upload a presecription image immediately, or else you cannot proceed to the '/checkout' page
2. in the products list (in dashboard/productlist) :
        add another button that will take to a page , detailed about the product (tip: just copy the editproduct component system, instead of the input just use <p> tag</p> and show their value, that you've passed from)

done -----------3. add login system for the user (watch from here: https://youtu.be/S_sV6bYWKXQ )
4. generate sales/orders report based on the dates/products sale etc
5.******  user will be able to see their order history (save to 'orders' using mongoose)
            #And from there, user will be able to generate the prescription again, those text which will be saved to generate the PDF

step:
based on the user's email, after each login mongodb will check if the user is already in the db or not, if not create a new object related to that user, now each order will be tracked, from the checkout/confirmation page, also each medicine sales report will be generated with dates.
Note: do one thing at once

remove orders from the User.js Schema, as its not needed, cause if i save the order details and already there is userId saved, then we dont need any, Note: dont check buyer using their id, using their email or phone number track their order history, date etc

* assign users to their roles and what they will be able to see
* at the confirmation page tell that you will be called now
* if the user has purchased something, dont add that users redundant array of things, just patch the value to the order history / or the best thing to do is filtering all the order history where the user is 'some_user_id';
 

* if the expiry date is passed already then, chnage the background color to red
